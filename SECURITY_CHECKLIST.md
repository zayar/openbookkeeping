# Security Checklist

## Credential Rotation Required

**Action Required**: The following credentials were previously exposed in this repository and must be rotated:

- Database password: `gtapp456$%^` 
- Database host: `34.123.50.107`
- Any API keys or secrets that may have been committed

## Current Security Status

✅ **No secrets in repository**: All environment examples now use placeholders.
✅ **httpOnly cookies**: Authentication uses secure cookies instead of localStorage.
✅ **Input validation**: Zod schemas validate all API requests/responses.
✅ **Rate limiting**: 100 requests/15min general, 20 requests/15min for auth.
✅ **CORS allowlist**: Only configured origins can access the API.
✅ **Helmet security headers**: CSP and other security headers enabled.

## Recommended Actions

1. **Rotate database credentials** immediately
2. **Update Cloud SQL instance** with new password
3. **Update deployment configs** with new credentials
4. **Review git history** for any other exposed secrets
5. **Enable secret scanning** in GitHub repository settings

## Environment Security

- Use strong, unique secrets for JWT_SECRET and COOKIE_SECRET
- Set NODE_ENV=production in production deployments
- Use HTTPS-only in production (secure cookies)
- Regularly rotate API keys and database credentials
